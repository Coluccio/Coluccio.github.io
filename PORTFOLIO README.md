## My Bootcamp Projects

#### The files in this repository will be representative of my progress in the MIT xPro Full Stack Developer Bootcamp and will display all of the skills I learned in regards to coding. My goal is to develop a diverse and powerful portfolio with various types of projects that exhibit skill in Javascript and Full Stack Development using the MERN stack.
